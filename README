Awesome NLS (Non-linear Schroedinger) is (currently) a finite difference solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii (a specific type of nonlinear Schroedinger) equation. It was primarily developed in the Bose-Einstein condensation lab at Georgia Southern with the goal of improving archaic Fortran programs to give better organization, information and record keeping, modular structure for addition of new computational techniques, and scalability for parallel computing.
